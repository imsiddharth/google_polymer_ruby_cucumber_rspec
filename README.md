# Google Polymer Object

This purpose of this project is to explain the basic understanding of how the polymer object works

Traditional approach to automate the web application don't work on polymer object.

The project required some gems.

rspec
selenium-webdriver
cucumber
rake

The gems can be installed using command " gem install gem_name ".
gems can also be installed using bundler.

Thanks,
